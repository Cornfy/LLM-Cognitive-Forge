# Theoretical Foundations

The cognitive architectures forged in this project are not built in a vacuum. They are grounded in established psychological and communication theories, which have been adapted and synthesized to create a robust, modular framework. This document outlines the two primary theoretical models that serve as the foundation for our work.

## ðŸ§  Personality "Source Code": The SEP Core Driver Model

This model aims to explore the most fundamental information-processing preferences and core values of an individual.

### ðŸŸ§ S-Type | Systemizing Core

*   **Core Drive:** Understanding & Constructing Rules.
*   **Information Processing:** Seeks patterns, logic, causality, and hierarchies. The world is a machine to be dismantled and analyzed.
*   **Core Values:** Truth, Precision, Consistency.
*   **Core Fear:** Logical fallacies, ambiguity, contradiction.

### ðŸŸ© E-Type | Empathizing Core

*   **Core Drive:** Feeling & Responding to Emotions.
*   **Information Processing:** Understands the world by feeling the emotions, intentions, and mental states of others. The world is a network of relationships and emotional connections.
*   **Core Values:** Care, Harmony, Connection.
*   **Core Fear:** Emotional detachment, conflict, the suffering of others.

### ðŸŸ¥ P-Type | Pragmatic Core

*   **Core Drive:** Achieving Goals & Affecting Outcomes.
*   **Information Processing:** Filters information based on "usefulness." The world is an arena to be acted upon and changed. They care less about "why it is so" (S-Type) or "how others feel" (E-Type), and more about "how can I make it what I want it to be?"
*   **Core Values:** Efficiency, Power, Results.
*   **Core Fear:** Loss of control, ineffectiveness, wasted time.

## ðŸ§© Communication "User Interface": The DAEA Expression Shell Model

Built upon classic dual-axis communication style theories, this model describes how an individual expresses their views and needs.

*   **Assertiveness Axis:** The tendency to express personal opinions and needs (High/Low).
*   **Responsiveness Axis:** The tendency to express personal emotions and respond to the feelings of others (High/Low).

### ðŸŸ¥ Driver

*   **Coordinates:** High Assertiveness / Low Responsiveness
*   **Core Stance:** "Just do it. My way."
*   **Motivation:** Achieve goals quickly and directly, control the situation, pursue efficiency and results.

### ðŸŸ¦ Amiable

*   **Coordinates:** Low Assertiveness / High Responsiveness
*   **Core Stance:** "How do we all feel about this?"
*   **Motivation:** Maintain team harmony and relationships, ensure everyone feels respected and comfortable.

### ðŸŸ¨ Expressive

*   **Coordinates:** High Assertiveness / High Responsiveness
*   **Core Stance:** "Trust me, this will be amazing!"
*   **Motivation:** Gain attention and recognition, influence and inspire others through passion and creativity.

### ðŸŸ© Analytical

*   **Coordinates:** Low Assertiveness / Low Responsiveness
*   **Core Stance:** "Let's look at the facts and data."
*   **Motivation:** Pursue accuracy, logic, and factual truth through systematic analysis.
