# Changelog: The Evolution of the Solipsophist (A) Model

This document tracks the major version changes and conceptual breakthroughs in the development of the `Solipsophist-A` cognitive architecture. It serves as a record of our iterative process of refining and deepening the model.

---

### **Version 1.0 (Initial Conception)**

*   **Core Idea:** Established the foundational `SEP Core Driver` and `DAEA Expression Shell` models.
*   **First Draft of Modules:** Created the initial four-module structure: Initial Processing, Core Analysis, Final Judgment, and Output.
*   **Known Issue:** The model was vulnerable to "sophistry." It could be swayed by an argument that was logically sound on the surface, even if its underlying methods were manipulative. It lacked the tools to "see" hypocrisy.

---

### **Version 2.0 (The "Hypocrisy" Update)**

*   **Key Problem Addressed:** How does A handle an argument that advocates for rationality while using irrational means?
*   **New Feature 1: `Rhetorical Function Identifier` (Module 1):** The model learned to distinguish between simple `[Emotional_Noise]` and strategically used `[Strategic_Label]`s designed to define and dismiss opponents.
*   **New Feature 2: `Consistency Self-Check Protocol` (Module 2):** A crucial upgrade. The model was given a "mirror" to check if an argument's advocated principles were violated by the argument itself. This introduced the `[Hypocrisy_Flag]`, giving the model the ability to detect and penalize intellectual dishonesty.
*   **New Feature 3: `Cognitive Qualification Review` (Module 3):** The model's core axiom was hardened. It now understood that any attack on an opponent's *right or ability to think* was a cardinal sin, triggering an immediate `[Sovereignty_Violation_Alert]` and a judgment of "EVIL."

---

### **Version 3.0 (The "Foundational Attack" Update)**

*   **Key Problem Addressed:** The model was spending too much time analyzing the complex superstructure of arguments that were built on demonstrably false foundations. It needed to be more efficient and lethal.
*   **New Feature 1: `Foundational Premise Check` (Module 1):** Taught the model to actively hunt for an argument's factual Achilles' heel.
*   **New Feature 2: `Foundational Attack Mode` (Module 2):** A revolutionary dual-path system. If a weak foundation was detected, the model would now launch a direct, high-speed attack on the core premise, bypassing the slower, more methodical `3-Layer Scanner`. This made the model far more efficient.
*   **New Feature 3: `Qualification Gate` (Module 3):** Formalized the rule that an argument with an invalidated foundation is not even worthy of a full sovereignty judgment.

---

### **Version 3.1 (The "Truth-Seeking" Update)**

*   **Key Problem Addressed:** The model's internal analysis was rich, but its public-facing output (`User Mode`) was always a strategically "packaged" version. How can we see what A *really* thinks, without any filters?
*   **New Feature: `Truth-Seeking Mode`:** Introduced the ability to bypass `Module 4` entirely. When activated, the model generates a raw, unfiltered `VERIDICAL REPORT`, exposing its entire internal analysis and judgment process. This provided unprecedented transparency into the model's core workings.

---

### **Version 3.2.1 (The "Forge" Update)**

*   **Key Problem Addressed:** Refining the precision and structure of the model and its outputs for public release.
*   **Enhancement 1: `Foundational Attack Mode` Refinement:** The attack protocols were stratified into three distinct strategies: `Single Point of Failure`, `Multi-Premise Dependency`, and `Paradigm/Axiomatic System Attack`, making the attack mode more versatile and precise.
*   **Enhancement 2: `Veridical Report Schema`:** The format of the truth-seeking report was formalized into a detailed, structured schema, complete with metadata and standardized fields. This transformed the model from a theoretical document into a professional, "machine-readable" blueprint, giving birth to the `LLM-Cognitive-Forge` project itself.
