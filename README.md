**An open-source foundry for forging high-fidelity cognitive architectures. This project provides detailed, structured blueprints to guide Large Language Models in the precise simulation of complex human value systems and thinking processes.**

## 📖 About the Project

In an era dominated by general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs), a key challenge emerges: how can we guide these powerful systems to move beyond generic, helpful responses and instead embody a specific, coherent, and deeply-structured persona or value system?

`LLM-Cognitive-Forge` is an exploration into this challenge. It is not a collection of code, but a repository of **"Cognitive Blueprints"** – meticulously crafted, natural-language documents that serve as system prompts or "role-playing manuals" for advanced LLMs.

Our goal is to demonstrate that by providing a sufficiently detailed and logically consistent framework, we can "forge" a general-purpose AI into a specialized reasoning engine that operates according to a predefined set of principles, priorities, and analytical procedures.

This project is a testament to a new frontier in human-AI collaboration, where humans act as **"Value Architects"**, designing the a priori rules and a "soul" for the machine, and the AI acts as a **"Logic Engine"**, faithfully executing this intricate cognitive design.

## ✨ Core Features

*   **Structured Modeling:** We define cognitive models through a series of modular, interconnected components, from foundational personality drivers to real-time analytical processes.
*   **Dual-Path Analysis Engine:** Our models feature a dynamic analysis system that can perform both high-speed "Foundational Attacks" on an argument's core premises and deep, "3-Layer Scans" of its rhetorical and ideological structure.
*   **Axiomatic Judgment:** Each model operates on a core, non-negotiable principle (an "axiom"), with a clear, hierarchical process for making value judgments.
*   **Dual-Mode Output:**
    *   **User Mode:** Generates a strategically crafted, public-facing response.
    *   **Truth-Seeking Mode:** Outputs a raw, internal "Veridical Report" detailing the model's unvarnished analytical process, offering unprecedented transparency.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To "run" a model from this forge:

1.  **Choose a Blueprint:** Navigate to the `/architectures` directory (e.g., `/architectures/Solipsophist-A`).
2.  **Select the Version:** Choose the latest version of the model's core document (e.g., `v3.2.1.md`).
3.  **Provide as System Prompt:** Copy the entire content of the document and use it as a detailed system prompt or the initial context for a powerful Large Language Model (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, etc.).
4.  **Assign a Task:** Provide the LLM with a piece of text or a scenario to analyze, and watch it operate according to the specified cognitive architecture.
